I am a Data Scientist and Analyst in Nairobi, Kenya, with five years of experience in providing data-driven business solutions and product development support. I have a bachelor's in Forestry science and an on-going MSc in Geospatial Information Science and Remote sensing. My research aims to model the risk of geographic invasion and distribution of Bactrocera zonata in Eastern Africa based on current distribution of the pest in prelevance areas and assessment of availability of plant hosts, pest population availability and climatology suitability.

I have a keen interest in using data to provide solutions at the intersection of environment, finance, and economic development. 


I am currently a DRIP MSc. Scholar at [icipe](http://www.icipe.org/capacity_building/students/benjamin-mwamburi-mwasambo-kenya)and a  Data Scientist at [Blue Marble Microinsurance](https://bluemarblemicro.com/team), previously worked as a Data Scientist at [FarmDrive Limited](https://farmdrive.co.ke/) and a GIS data analyst intern at Kenya Forest Service. I have technical skills of using R and SQL to analyze spatial and non-spatial datasets(see my projects), additional to GIS and Remote Sensing software.
