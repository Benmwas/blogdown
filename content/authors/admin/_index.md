I am a Data Scientist and Analyst in Nairobi, Kenya, with five years of experience in providing data-driven business solutions and product development support. I have a bachelor's in Forestry science and an on-going MSc in Geospatial Information Science and Remote sensing. My research focuses on vegetation change analysis using time-series Landsat(satellite) data and machine learning.

I have a keen interest in using data to provide solutions at the intersection of environment, finance, and economic development. 


I am currently a Data Scientist at [Blue Marble Microinsurance](https://bluemarblemicro.com/team), previously worked as a Data Scientist at [FarmDrive Limited](https://farmdrive.co.ke/) and a GIS data analyst intern at Kenya Forest Service. I have technical skills of using R and SQL to analyze spatial and non-spatial datasets(see my projects), additional to GIS and Remote Sensing software.
