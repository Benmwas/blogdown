<p>The selling of agricultural produce to consumers is one of the crucial stages in the agricultural value chain. However, the chain actors; producers(farmers), traders, and consumers may lack sufficient information about prevailing and historical regional market prices.</p>
<p>This analysis shows trends for agricultural commodities prices in different regions from January 2018 to April 2020. Daily data was downloaded from <a href="http://www.nafis.go.ke/category/market-info/">NAFIS</a> website. Many thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perisbosire/">Peris Bosire</a> for conducting extensive market data research and advising on these datasets’ usage.</p>
<p>Averages for monthly market prices in each region were used to analyze the trends. Rigorous cleaning of the data, which includes merging daily data files, was done, and the final ‘clean data’ was used for this analysis. However, a gap in data acquisition was observed from December 2018 to April 2020.</p>
<p>Only a few regions and commodities(with sufficient data) were selected for this analysis.</p>
<p><em>One caveat: Imputation of row means was done for commodities with missing price values.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>RM = rowMeans(clean_data[, 6:26], na.rm = TRUE)

#Missing row values for Nairobi

clean_data$Nairobi[is.na(clean_data$Nairobi)] = RM[is.na(clean_data$Nairobi)]</code></pre>
<p>Data acquisation dates were also converted to Month-Year.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(lubridate)
