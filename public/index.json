Some of the key metrics include, but are not limited to, expected return, return rate, loan repayment ratio, actual returns/repayment, total amount overdue.\nOverall, loan portfolio analysis is required when determining the ‘health’ of business. Accurate analysis of loan data will help make critical decisions that will support other departments’ operations, such as collections and customer support, and marketing.\nThis project entails an in-depth analysis of a fintech case loan product; datasets were obtained from a public domain. Given the dataset, different problems were addressed, and insights were obtained through analysis from the data.\nProblems\n To understand from the data, the order at which subsequent customers purchased more than one product. Draw a pattern between the age of customers and products purchased. Repayment behavior measured with Timely Repayment Percentage (TRP) and the choice of product bought. Pattern between gender and choice of product bought. Length/number of days it takes for customers to fully repay their loans, addressing distribution and differences between the products. Given the products’ historical demand and repayment pattern, which one would you push for and why? The products demand trends over time.

The trend shows high age and products’ correlations in LPG2 and CNVS. There was a high demand for LPG2 between 18 and 50 years and a diminished demand in the age above 50 years with a less than 25% of the products purchased. On the other hand, CNVS was highly demanded by older age as compared to a younger age class. A pattern was observed in age, and this product demand; product demand increased with age.\n2.1 Age-products analysis for top demanded products\nTop_Percent \u0026lt;- Percentage %\u0026gt;% filter(Product==\u0026quot;CNVS\u0026quot; | Product==\u0026quot;LPG2\u0026quot; | Product==\u0026quot;LPG3\u0026quot; | Product==\u0026quot;BORA\u0026quot; | Product==\u0026quot;P400\u0026quot;) The trend line graph below explains in detail the relationship between age and products, as described above.\n3.

To better understand all products’ repayment behavior, the percentage of each product loan status was analyzed.For instance, if a loan product has a high rate of arrears and write-offs (Overdue and written off status) and a very low percentage of closed loans, this should be considered ‘bad’ or poorly performing. Hence, a call for better collection strategies, the right customers’ target for the product or even seasonal consideration and, geographic distribution.\nDemand \u0026lt;- data %\u0026gt;% group_by(Product,Status) %\u0026gt;% summarise(count = n()/20) Demand_plot \u0026lt;- group_by(Demand, Product) %\u0026gt;% mutate(Percentage = (count/sum(count))*100) Demand_plot[,4] \u0026lt;- round(Demand_plot[,4], digits = 1) Demand_plot_plotII \u0026lt;- Demand_plot %\u0026gt;% group_by(Product) %\u0026gt;% arrange(Product, desc(Status)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(lab_ypos = cumsum(Percentage)- 0.5 * Percentage) options(scipen = 999) #display top rows and columns head(Demand_plot_plotII) ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## # Groups: Product [2] ## Product Status count Percentage lab_ypos ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 B00M Written Off 0.05 0.3 0.15 ## 2 B00M Overdue 4.2 23.7 12.2 ## 3 B00M Closed 10.2 57.3 52.6 ## 4 B00M Active 3.3 18.6 90.6 ## 5 BOOM Written Off 1.5 2.5 1.25 ## 6 BOOM Overdue 11.4 19.1 12.0 The graph below shows a combination of demand and product performance. The maroon line graph shows how the product was demanded, and the scale was reduced by 20 units(n/20). LPG2, LPG3, and BORA were highly demanded consecutively. Things to note: Given the above trends, the top 3 demanded products have great potential in terms of acquisition and repayments. However, a lot of focus needs to be geared towards collecting the active loans for BORA product and reducing delinquent loans for LPG3 to less than 10%. Two products to keep an eye on in terms of collection and recovery instead of acquisition are HOME and TNK. These products have high delinquents and active loans compared to closed loans. The collection team should as well focus on reducing the non-performing loans for all product/ portfolio at risk (PAR) to less than 10%. Therefore, this calls for a review of collection strategies: SMS contents, time to send messages, and incentives.\n7.Time series products demand\nAnalysis of product demand over time is essential to understand when the different products are demanded. Such might as well provide great insights to the marketing team. Disbursement date was used and converted to Month-Year.\n#create a product demand dataset data$`Disbursed Date` \u0026lt;- as.Date(data$`Disbursed Date`, format = \u0026quot;%Y-%m-%d\u0026quot;) Time_series \u0026lt;- data %\u0026gt;% group_by(Product, `Disbursed Date`) %\u0026gt;% summarise(count = n()) Time_series_plot \u0026lt;- Time_series %\u0026gt;% group_by(Product, Month) %\u0026gt;% mutate(Total = sum(count)) Time_series_plot$Month \u0026lt;- format(as.Date(Time_series_plot$`Disbursed Date`), \u0026quot;%b - %Y\u0026quot;) Time_series_plot \u0026lt;- read_excel(\u0026quot;demand.xlsx\u0026quot;) Time_series_plot$Month \u0026lt;- factor(Time_series_plot$Month, levels = c(\u0026quot;Jan - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Feb - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Mar - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Apr - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;May - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Jun - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Jul - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Aug - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Sep - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Oct - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Nov - 2019\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Dec - 2019\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Jan - 2020\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Feb - 2020\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Mar - 2020\u0026quot;)) There has been a shift in demand for different products over time from the above general time series trends. For instance, LPG2, BORA, and CNVS were highly demanded in February and March 2020. There was a low demand shift for products between October 2019 and January 2020.\n7.1.Time series analysis for Top products\nAfter filtering the top products,there was a peak demand for CNVS between August 2019 and December 2019. The need for JIKO has been relatively constant across the analysis period.\n8.Daily loans repayment analysis\nThe Final repayment date was used to analyze for the repayment days. This analysis shows progressive loan repayments with days of the week. However, the difference in not much dispersed. Low repayments were observed over the weekend. Knowledge of repayment days will be very crucial when it comes to collection.\nShifting collection to the most likely repaying days will ensure proper resource allocation in terms of the number of messages to send in a week or number of customers to be contacted. Better still, if the repayments are low over the weekend, what strategies need to be put in place if the collection team is not working over the weekend? Curate and schedule specific repayment reminder messages on Friday evening?\n#Generate weeks data Week \u0026lt;- data %\u0026gt;% group_by(Product, `Final Payment Date`) %\u0026gt;% summarise(count = n()) Week$`Final Payment Date` \u0026lt;- as.Date(Week$`Final Payment Date`, format = \u0026quot;%Y-%m-%d\u0026quot;) #change date into days of the week Week$day \u0026lt;- format(as.Date(Week$`Final Payment Date`), \u0026quot;%A\u0026quot;) Week_plot \u0026lt;- group_by(Week, day) %\u0026gt;% mutate(Total = sum(count)) Week_plot \u0026lt;- Week %\u0026gt;% group_by(day) %\u0026gt;% summarise(sum(count)) Week_plot \u0026lt;- Week_plot[-c(8), ] names(Week_plot) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Day\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Total_Repayment\u0026quot;) Week_plot$Day \u0026lt;- factor(Week_plot$Day, levels = c(\u0026quot;Monday\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Tuesday\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Wednesday\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Thursday\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Friday\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Saturday\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Sunday\u0026quot;)) ","date":1599004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599004800,"objectID":"437b882a212b115c706a420212997442","permalink":"/project/insights-from-loan-portfolio-analysis-for-a-fintech-loan-product/","publishdate":"2020-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/insights-from-loan-portfolio-analysis-for-a-fintech-loan-product/","section":"project","summary":"To gain actionable insights from a case FinTech product, we shall do an in-depth analysis of customers' loan dataset.","tags":["Data analysis","Data visualization","Communication","Insights"],"title":"Insights from Loan portfolio analysis for a FinTech loan product","type":"project"},{"authors":["Benjamin Mwasambo"],"categories":["R"],"content":"App will be deployed soon\u0026hellip;.\n","date":1599004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599004800,"objectID":"bafb3e00d74c28743076a6c684b22b72","permalink":"/project/interactive-web-map-with-leaflet-and-shiny-in-r/","publishdate":"2020-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/interactive-web-map-with-leaflet-and-shiny-in-r/","section":"project","summary":"A web application/map  developed in R using shiny and leaflet packages to show the spatial effects of Cyclone Idai at district and ward level in Zimbabwe.","tags":["Web mapping","GIS","leaflet","shiny"],"title":"Interactive web map with leaflet and Shiny in R","type":"project"},{"authors":["Benjamin Mwasambo"],"categories":["R","Database"],"content":" Minimal data interactions\nEveryone would want to minimize the hassle of handling data through various channels and lengthy processes; personally, it bothers me.

Both vector(points, lines, polygons) and raster data are supported in reading and write modes. In most cases, geospatial users will enable this extension when installing PostgreSQL.

The ultimate goal of any spatial data analysis or research is to communicate the key outputs. Visualization of spatial data inform of maps comes in handy when sharing useful insights that inform critical decision making.\nHere, I would like to share my experience of spatial data visualization from different data analysis problems.\nRegions of interest(ROI)\nWhen doing a study/analysis involving a specific area(s) given a broader geographic location, you might be required to display a particular region(s) of interest. This map shows a case of areas of interest at the county level in Kenya from counties shapefile data.\nFigure 1: Regions of Interest\n Parcels distribution within sub-counties\nParcels (point features) are distributed within polygon features(sub-counties boundaries). Point features can be schools, shops, hospitals, events occurring, e.t.c. Information on both points and polygons is stored in attributes.\nThe map below shows that parcels are located exclusively in the selected sub-counties. Such information is relevant. It gives insights that can be used for planning purposes or service delivery since we are narrowing down from more comprehensive geographic location(County level) to sub-counties level.\nFigure 2: Point features distribution\n Regional customers purchase segmentation\nYou might want to understand the cumulative customers’ purchase within your customers’ regional coverage. Total sales data can as well be displayed on a map and variations color-coded.\nFigure 3: Regional customers purchase\n Humanitarian response to Cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe\nThis map links to my project about humanitarian organizations’ efforts in response to the devastating cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe in March 2019.
